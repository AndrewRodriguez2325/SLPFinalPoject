A classifier that will attempt to take in some news articles and provide their appropriate category
Based on the inherent properties of the text, it should be able to determine what features correlate correctly to certain categories.
A news article classifier can be beneficial to huge news sources like BBC, HuffPost, CNN in addition to news forums where hundreds of miscellaneous articles are stored
For text classification, use intrinsic evaluation that focuses primarily on the performance of an NLP component on a defined task. 
Accuracy is most appropriate as we want to evaluate the closeness of a measured value to a known value.
I will also look at precision and recall and calculate the F1 score.
